React Skinny Boiler Plate.

Decided to come up with a simple React, Webpack , SASS Build for personal projects. Feel free to grab it as well.

Will be extending TS support if need be.

Documentation coming soon but for now, `npm install` and create a `.babelrc` file in the root of your project with the following:

```
{
    "presets": [
        "@babel/preset-env", "@babel/preset-react"
    ]
}
```

Rock out!

And Oh Yeah, there is HMR off the bat because Webpack 4.
